# Stay in Touch!

Thanks for purchasing this book. If you are interested in
hearing more from me about things that I'm working on (books, data
science courses, podcast, etc.), you can do two things.

First, I encourage you to join my mailing list of [Leanpub
Readers](http://eepurl.com/bAJ3zj). On this list I send out updates of
my own activities as well as occasional comments on data science
current events. I'll also let you know what my co-conspirators Jeff
Leek and Brian Caffo are up to because sometimes they do really cool
stuff.

Second, I have a regular podcast called [Not So Standard
Deviations](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast) that I co-host with
Dr. Hilary Parker, a Senior Data Analyst at Etsy. On this podcast,
Hilary and I talk about the craft of data science and discuss common
issues and problems in analyzing data. We'll also compare how data
science is approached in both academia and industry contexts and
discuss the latest industry trends. 

You can listen to recent episodes on our SoundCloud page or you can
subscribe to it in
[iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/not-so-standard-deviations/id1040614570)
or your favorite podcasting app.


Thanks again for purchasing this book and please do stay in touch!
