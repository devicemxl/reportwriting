# Public Reproducibility Resources

This chapter provides a list of resources that you may find useful when making your code and data available to others. The list is certainly incomplete, but provides a sense what what's out there. Keep in mind that all of these resources are primarily designed around making things *publicly* available. If you do not want the public to access your material, you may need to seek other resources (or pay a fee).

## Code Repositories

* [GitHub](https://github.com): this site hosts git repositories for free if they are public and for a fee if they are private. GitHub offers a lot of features for collaborating with others such as the ability to track issues and for others to merge changes into your repository. Hosting a repository here typically obviates the need for a separate mailing list as many of the communication aspects are built in.
* [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net): An older site that similarly hosts code repositories including those based on Mercurial, git, or subversion. Features also include issue tracking and discussion forums.
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org): similar to other sites described above, Bitbucket hosts repositories based on Mercurial or git and allows for simple collaboration between project team members. Pricing is based on the number of users collaborating on a repository. They also have a special plan for academics (if you have a .edu email address).
* [repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz): this site was one of the original repositories for hosting git repositories. It is free, and is still running, but has largely been overtaken by other sites like GitHub, which offer far more in the way of features.
* [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org): this is the central repository for R packages. If you develop code for R, in addition to hosting your source code on a site like GitHub, it's probably wise to put a package on CRAN so that others can easily install it.

It may be logical to host data in a code repository, if the datasets are small and manageable (typically "toy" datasets or demonstration datasets). Large datasets are usually not suitable for hosting in a code repository.

## Data Repositories

* [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov): The National Center for Biotechnology Information hosts a number of databases to which you can upload data for scientific publications and from which you can obtain publicly available data. It is an enormous resource for biological data and the go-to place for biological researchers looking to deposit their data.
* [Dataverse](http://dataverse.org): This site is run out of Harvard's Institute for Quantitative and Social Science as a place where researchers can host their data with their papers. Datasets get a permanent unique ID that can be referenced elsewhere.	
* [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/landing.jsp): The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research is another repository for datasets, typically in the social sciences.


## Publication Repositories

* [R Pubs](http://rpubs.com): this is a fairly simple web site hosted by [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) that allows for the simple publication of HTML documents created using the RStudio development environment. If you are creating an R markdown document in RStudio, you can, with the click of a button, publish the HTML version of that document to RPubs and immediately make it publicly available. RPubs will provide you with a permanent unique link that you can share with others.

* [GitHub](https://github.com): Although GitHub is a source code repository, it can be quite useful for hosting documents too. In particular, the web site will automatically interpret markdown documents and prettify them so that people can view the directly from the repository in their web browser.
